% imc2010.sty - very similar to imc2.sty but with minor changes by David
%               Asher specifically for Proc. IMC 2010
%               2010oct6


% imc2.sty - version 2.2.05 (copied from imc2.sty v2.2.03), 2006jun22
% 	Style file for IMC & RMS
%	Currently used almost identically for both Proceedings
% 	The only difference is that IMC defines an IMCpaper but RMS an RMSpaper.
%	These differences are edited in manually.
%	The two versions may diverge over the years, of course.


% Start by loading the standard MO-wide stuff:
\input{imo2.sty}

% IMC-specific (re-)definitions here:

\newcommand{\bibcode}[2]{%
% IMC currently prints just IMO bibcodes; if time allows, the NASA-ADS
% bibcodes may be added.
%
% Since IMC has \thanks at the top, the normal usage is norule.
% If they say here or here-norule, they mean it, though.
	\ifthenelse{\equal{#2}{} \or \equal{#2}{norule}}
		{\bibcodeMaster{imo}{#1}{norule}}%
		{\bibcodeMaster{imo}{#1}{#2}}%
}

\newenvironment{IMCpaper}[1]
	{% \begin{IMCpaper}
		\begin{IMOpaper}{twocol}{#1}
		
		% Note that the above blank line is needed. Without it, 
		% the \title{} is indented slightly - don't understand why.
	}% \begin{Rpaper}
	{% \end{IMCpaper}
		\end{IMOpaper}%
	}% \end{IMCpaper}

% ** IMCpaper was retained for a while, to allow an easy transition
% \newenvironment{IMCpaper} ...

% -------------- Modifications to standard (imo2.sty) definitions --------------

% Anything defined in imo2.sty can be modified here. 
% All that is needed is to find the relevant command(s) in imo2.sty, understand 
% them, and write a modified form here, often using LaTeX commands such as 
% \renewcommand and \renewenvironment to over-write existing definitions.

% Some of the imo2.sty material is copied here, for two reasons:
% 1. There are some definitions, e.g. page headers, which it will be more or 
%	less essential to redefine. (Defaults are provided in case they are 
%	not redefined.)
% 2. There are things such as the style of titles which are more likely to 
%	be modified. To save searching in imo2.sty, commented-out examples 
%	are provided here, with explanatory comments.


%	-	-	Headers and footers	-	-	-	-

% Set the text of the headers and footers:
% The form of these commands is
%	\XY[format for even-numbered pages]{format for odd-numbered pages}
% where	X is l, c or r	for left, centre and right respectively;
% and	Y is head or foot.

\lhead[{\SetHeaderFont \thepage}]{{\SetHeaderFont \PageTitle}}
\rhead[{\SetHeaderFont \PageTitle}]{{\SetHeaderFont \thepage}}
% In the above, note the extra surrounding sets of {} so the effects of 
% \SetHeader/FooterStyle do not propagate beyond the headers and footers.
\lfoot{} \rfoot{} \chead{} \cfoot{} % Set the centre head and all 3 footers to blank.

% If lines below the header or above the footer are required, the following 
% can be uncommented and modified as wished:
\renewcommand{\headrulewidth}{0.3pt} % Thickness of horizontal line below header

% The above Headers and Footers commands (other than \pagestyle) are 
% from package fancyheadings. For further details
% see Goossens, Mittelbach & Samarin / The LaTeX Companion
% (Section 4.3.2, p.96, in the first edition)


%	-	-	Styles of headings	-	-	-

% Form to be used with non-Euler fonts:
\renewcommand{\PageTitle}{Proceedings of the IMC, Kutn√° Hora, 2024}
% Form to be used with Euler fonts (which have some characters 
%	only in maths mde):
%\newcommand{\PageTitle}{WGN$,$ the Journal of the IMO 
%			\IssueVolume{}$:$\IssueNumber{} $($\IssueYear$)$}


%	-	-	-	Fonts	-	-	-	-

% The fonts are set up in imo2.sty. They can be modified here if required.
% One or more of the following lines can be uncommented and modified as
% required.
% (These are copies of the lines in imo2.sty, except that there they 
% use \newcommand not \renewcommand.)

% \fontsize and \usefont: Goossens, Mittelback & Samarin sections 7.6.1 & 7.6.2 
% (pages 188-193) describe it.
% \fontsize is on p.189 and \usefont on p.192. The 3rd and 4th parameters to
% \usefont are in Table 7.10 (p.190) and Table 7.11 (p.191).

%\renewcommand{\SetSectionTitleFont}	{\fontsize{17.28}{17.28}\usefont{T1}{cmfib}{m} {n}}
	% Section titles are not used in Proceedings. (In WGN, these are things 
	% like "Leonids" at the start of one or more papers which are a section 
	% of the journal.)
	
% Sizes set by Jean-Marc Wislez for RMS Proceedings 2005 (2006-03-24);
% copied identically for IMC (2006 Jun 22).
\renewcommand{\SetPaperTitleFont}	{\fontsize{17.28}{20}\bf\selectfont}
\renewcommand{\SetPaperAuthorFont}	{\fontsize{12}{14}\bf\selectfont}
\renewcommand{\SetPaperThanksFont}	{\fontsize{10}{12}\selectfont}
			% NOTE this initially used \newcommand not \renewcommand, 
			% as imo2.sty didn't use or define a \SetPaperThanksFont.
			% This latter and thus the former have now changed.
			% *** Remove this comment after autumn 2006.

%	-	-	Section (etc.) commands		-	-	-	-

% The format of the start of each paper (title, author, etc.) 
% and of \section{} and \subsection{} are defined in imo2.sty.
% They can be modified here if wished. 
% Uncomment the following definitions and modify.
% (The following are copies of the definitions in imo2.sty, except that 
% \sectiontitle, \thankstext  and \datereceived 
% there are \newcommand, not \renewcommand as here.)

% When modifying the start-of-paper definitions, note that several rule 
% across the page to separate their information from the next section down.
% Testing your modifications should include a selection of papers with and

				% change from \thanks to \thankstext. Keep them in 
				% the same order! Follow the last one with a
