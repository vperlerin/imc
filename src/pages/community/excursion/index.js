      <p>Due to an update in logistics, the originally planned boat trip on the river Vecht has been replaced with a rich cultural excursion to the historic city of Utrecht. While we were unable to secure a boat with sufficient capacity, we're excited to offer an alternative program that will be equally memorable and enriching.</p>
