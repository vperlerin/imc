        In that case, please select the <strong>"no accommodation"</strong> option on the registration form.

        Barcelonnette and the Ubaye Valley offer a range of hotels, guesthouses, holiday residences, and campsites.
        As the town is relatively small and September is still part of the tourist season, we recommend booking early.
